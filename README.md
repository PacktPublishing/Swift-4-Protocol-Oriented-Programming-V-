# Swift 4 Protocol-Oriented Programming [Video]
This is the code repository for [Swift 4 Protocol-Oriented Programming [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/swift-4-protocol-oriented-programming-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788995160), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Swift has become the number one language used in iOS and macOS development. The Swift standard library is developed using Protocol-Oriented Programming techniques, generics, and first-class value semantics; therefore, every Swift developer should understand these powerful concepts and how to take advantage of them in their application design.
This course will help you understand the differences between Object-Oriented Programming and Protocol-Oriented Programming. It demonstrates how to work with Protocol-Oriented Programming using real-world use cases. You will gain a solid knowledge of the various types that can be used in Swift and the differences between value and reference types. You will be taught how Protocol-Oriented Programming techniques can be used to develop very flexible and easy-to-maintain code.
By the end of the course, you will have a thorough understanding of Protocol-Oriented Programming and how to utilize it to build powerful and practical applications.
